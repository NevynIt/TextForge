# md++ v0.14 Example Manifest

This manifest turns the language spec, diagnostic catalog, and compliance scenarios into concrete source fixtures.

## Drafting rules

- Keep fixtures minimal. Add only the source needed to prove the target behavior.
- Prefer `.md` for the main file and `.md`, `.css`, `.svg` for supporting resources where appropriate.
- Use deterministic content and simple wording.
- When a scenario is diagnostic-only, keep the rest of the document valid.
- Preserve source order for repeated directives.
- Repository examples keep repository content under `shared/` inside the example directory.
- Include examples use relative paths that make the intended resolution rule obvious.
- Layout, theme, and stylesheet examples use small readable resources rather than large integrated documents.

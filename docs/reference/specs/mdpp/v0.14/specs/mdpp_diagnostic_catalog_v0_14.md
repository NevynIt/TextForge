# md++ Diagnostic Catalog

[md:profile]: md++
[md:profile-version]: 0.14
[md:title]: <md++ Diagnostic Catalog>
[md:status]: draft

Status: draft 0.14  
Document type: Diagnostic code catalog  
Related language spec: `mdpp_language_spec_v0_14.md`  
Related runtime architecture: `mdpp_reference_runtime_architecture_v0_14.md`

This document assigns stable diagnostic codes for md++ language processors, runtime hosts, plugins, editors, reports, and tests.

The catalog is maintained separately from the language and runtime specifications so codes can remain stable while the specifications evolve.

## 1. Code format

Diagnostic codes use this form:

```text
MDPPNNNN
```

Ranges:

| Range | Area |
|---|---|
| `MDPP0001` - `MDPP0099` | Core document/profile/directive parsing |
| `MDPP0100` - `MDPP0199` | Requirements and capability resolution |
| `MDPP0200` - `MDPP0299` | Includes, repositories, and resources |
| `MDPP0300` - `MDPP0399` | Fenced blocks, models, and plugin-owned blocks |
| `MDPP0400` - `MDPP0499` | Themes, stylesheets, layouts, pages, and areas |
| `MDPP0500` - `MDPP0599` | Rendering, source maps, patches, and interactions |
| `MDPP0600` - `MDPP0699` | Runtime, plugins, manifests, IPC/RPC, and jobs |
| `MDPP0700` - `MDPP0799` | Import, export, and lossy conversion |
| `MDPP9000` - `MDPP9999` | Host-defined or experimental diagnostics |

## 3. Diagnostic object

Diagnostics SHOULD use the common runtime shape defined in the runtime architecture and represented in the JSON Schema skeleton:

```yaml
source: md.processor
severity: warning
code: MDPP0408
message: "Area 'right' overflows slide."
file: deck.md
line: 42
layout: layout-two-columns
area: right
```

## 4. Catalog maintenance rules

- A published code MUST NOT be reused for a different meaning.
- A code MAY be deprecated, but deprecated codes SHOULD remain documented.
- Default severities MAY be elevated or reduced by host policy when appropriate.
- Host-defined diagnostics SHOULD use the `MDPP9xxx` range or a host-specific prefix.
